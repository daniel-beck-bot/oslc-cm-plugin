This plugin is an OSLC-CM consumer. On the occurence of a build
failure, it allows automated creation of bug reports in bug trackers
having OSLC support, using Oauth and REST.

It also allows some user interaction mode to create bugs using an
OSLC-CM provider's delegated creation dialog.

For more details of the OSLC protocol, see
http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/CmHome

To rebuild the plugin, issue the following command in this directory :
 $ mvn package
